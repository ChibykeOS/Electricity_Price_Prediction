## Electricity Price Prediction Project
This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting electricity prices using a publicly available dataset. The project explores various steps of a typical machine learning workflow, from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and advanced ensemble techniques like stacking.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for electricity prices. Electricity price forecasting is a challenging task due to various influencing factors such as demand, supply (including renewable sources like wind and solar), weather conditions, and market dynamics.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Insert Dataset Source/URL here if you want, e.g., https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/electricity.csv]. It includes features like:

# Date and time information
Holiday indicators
Day of the week, week of the year, etc.
Forecast and actual wind production
System load
Temperature and wind speed
CO2 intensity
Electricity price (the target variable)
Project Steps
# The project followed these key steps:

**Data Loading and Exploration**:Loaded the data, examined data types, checked for missing values, and analyzed basic statistics.
**Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values (imputation), converted data types (to numeric and datetime), and addressed data inconsistencies.
**Feature Engineering**: Created new time-based features from the datetime column to capture seasonality and temporal patterns.
**Data Splitting**: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets.
**Model Training and Evaluation (Initial)**: Trained an initial LightGBM Regressor model and evaluated its performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
**Performance Improvement - Outlier Analysis and Transformation**: Investigated outliers in the target variable through visualization and explored the effect of a log transformation on the target.
**Performance Improvement - Hyperparameter Tuning**: Performed hyperparameter tuning on the LightGBM model using cross-validation to find optimal parameters.
**Evaluation of Tuned Model**: Evaluated the tuned LightGBM model, which showed improved performance (MAE: 9.87, RMSE: 21.91).
**Exploring Ensemble Methods - Stacking**: Began setting up a stacking ensemble framework to combine predictions from multiple diverse base models with a meta-model.
# Key Findings
The initial LightGBM model provided a baseline prediction.
Hyperparameter tuning on the LightGBM model significantly improved performance, resulting in the best model found so far.
An initial attempt at a stacking ensemble did not surpass the performance of the tuned LightGBM model in this instance.
The tuned LightGBM model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.87 and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 21.91 on the test set.
